# Hi, I'm Mikolaj!

I’m a first-year PhD student at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en), affiliated with the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk), under the supervision of [Christian Igel](https://christian-igel.github.io), with [Sebastian Weichwald](https://sweichwald.de) and [Yevgeny Seldin](https://sites.google.com/site/yevgenyseldin/home) as co-supervisors. In my research I’m interested in developing robust uncertainty quantification methods for machine learning (ML) and applying them to earth observation tasks with a mission to ensure that ML-driven environmental solutions are both reliable and impactful.

Please feel free to get in touch!

### Research


My current research focuses on developing methods that provide mathematically rigorous uncertainty estimates, even in the presence of strong model misspecification or when dealing with complex, heteroscedastic, and non-normal noise distributions. In particular, I explore frameworks such as conformal prediction and PAC-Bayesian analysis. Beyond the theoretical aspects, I am deeply passionate about the practical applications of machine learning. In my research, I aim to apply these uncertainty quantification methods to Earth observation tasks, where reliable uncertainty estimates are often crucial for decision-making. Prior to my PhD, my work centered on probabilistic machine learning and its applications in astrophysics and medicine.


### Teaching

Teaching Assistant at the University of Copenhagen during my Master's studies in three subsequent Master-level courses (2022-2023).

- [Machine Learning A](https://kurser.ku.dk/archive/2022-2023/course/NDAK22000U)
- [Machine Learning B](https://kurser.ku.dk/archive/2022-2023/course/NDAK22001U)
- [Online and Reinforcement Learning](https://kurser.ku.dk/archive/2022-2023/course/NDAK21003U)

Primary responsibilities included holding three-hour Q&A sessions, where I helped students with the weekly assignments and whole course material, and handling grading.


### Studies

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl), specializing in software engineering and mathematics. My Bachelor’s thesis focused on developing a [Kubernetes cluster autoscaler](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cluster-autoscaler) for [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com). During my studies, I also explored bioinformatics and had my first exposure to ML. This initial curiosity grew into a strong passion during the first year of my Master’s, also in Computer Science, at the University of Copenhagen. In my second year, I began teaching and gained hands-on ML research experience — first by working on a [medical ML project](https://github.com/mikmaz/ecg-norm-flow) outside the standard curriculum, and later through [my Master’s thesis](https://github.com/mikmaz/jwst-space-dust-thesis), which applied probabilistic ML to astrophysics. The promising results of my thesis led to a research assistant position at [DARK](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/astrophysics/dark/), where working alongside many inspiring scientists further fueled my passion for research and helped define my academic path.
